Description
-----------

Simple dependency lister for Ruby on Rails 2 views.  Given a partial, it will list a hierarchy of 
all views that depend on it.  This currently only handles cases where render is used specifically, 
such as the following example:

.View Code

----
= render :partial => 'partial_name'
----

Usage
-----

NOTE: The program must be run within the root project directory.

.Get views that depend on partial
----
$ depends app/views/shared/_partial_name.erb
----

.Get full hierarchy of all dependencies
----
$ depends
----

Output Format
-------------

The output is a simple tree format

----
Files depending on app/shared/_ad.rhtml
-app/views/content/index.rhtml
-app/views/content/_form.rhtml
--app/views/content/new.rhtml
--app/views/content/edit.rhtml
----

The number of dashes '-' equal the number of levels deep the dependency exists.
